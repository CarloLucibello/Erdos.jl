    betweenness_centrality(g, k=0; normalize=true, endpoints=false)


Calculates the [betweenness centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality#Betweenness_centrality) of
the graph `g`, or, optionally, of a random subset of `k` vertices. Can
optionally include endpoints in the calculations. Normalization is enabled by
default.

Betweenness centrality is defined as:

$bc(v) = \frac{1}{\mathcal{N}} \sum_{s \neq t \neq v}
        \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}$.

 **Parameters**

g: ASimpleGraph
    A Graph, directed or undirected.

k: Integer, optional
    Use `k` nodes sample to estimate the betweenness centrality. If none,
    betweenness centrality is computed using the `n` nodes in the graph.

normalize: bool, optional
    If true, the betweenness values are normalized by the total number
    of possible distinct paths between all pairs in the graphs. For an undirected graph,
    this number if `((n-1)*(n-2))/2` and for a directed graph, `(n-1)*(n-2)`
    where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph.

endpoints: bool, optional
    If true, endpoints are included in the shortest path count.

**Returns**

betweenness: Array{Float64}
    Betweenness centrality value per node id.
